See [Menu](/tutorial/preface.md)

## About `/tutorial/code`

Tons of sample codes are from [astaxie/build-web-application-with-golang](https://github.com/astaxie/build-web-application-with-golang), they will follow the BSD-3 License if not mentioned particularly. Highly appreciated. (Folders in `/tutorial/code` whose names start with the single digit 0-6 only.)

· Folders whose names start with the single digit 0-6 are for basic go grammar

· Folders whose names start with double-digits 10-?? are for more complex code snippets or nonsense tricks.
