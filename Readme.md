Tons of sample codes from [astaxie/build-web-application-with-golang](https://github.com/astaxie/build-web-application-with-golang). Highly appreciated. (Folders whose names start with single digit 0-6, basically.)

## About

· Folders whose names start with single digit 0-6 are for basic go grammar

· Folders whose names start with double-digits 10-?? are for more complex code snippets.
