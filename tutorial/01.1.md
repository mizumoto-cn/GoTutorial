tar -C /usr/local -xzf go<VERSION>.tar.gz
```

where <VERSION> is the version of Go that you downloaded (e.g., 1.19.3).

- Add the /usr/local/go/bin directory to your PATH environment variable. This can typically be done by adding the following line to your .bashrc file:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

- Verify that Go is installed correctly by opening a new terminal and running the `go version` command. This should print the version of Go that you have installed.
